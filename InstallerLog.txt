-:Additional Notes:- 
Do not forget to add AGREE=1 in your sphere.ini 
This should be placed somewhere under the [SPHERE] block, but above anything to do with file locations. 
To new users, do not forget to set your flags for additional content beyond UO:R. 
This is located under the Server Mechanics section in your sphere.ini file. 
 
Most of the information you might need is explained within the sphere.ini, revisions.txt, the manual.txt 
or on the www.spherecommunity.net forums. 
 
If you need help beyond this, please post on the forums. 
Thank you for downloading Sphere. 
 
WARNING: DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THIS 
Please do not forget, if an accounts file was set up, there will be an owner account made there. 
We advise in your best interest to edit the account name and the password.
